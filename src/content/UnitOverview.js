            Machine learning algorithms learn from the training data and adjust 
            based on feedback. The simplest type of learning is supervised 
            learning, which is when a model trains on a labeled dataset to 
            predict outputs given a set of inputs.

            Unit 1 covered supervised learning, which requires labeled datasets.
            However, a significant limitation on using labeled datasets is that 
            labeling is expensive. As a result, there is much more unlabeled
            data than labeled data. This section covers learning methods that can be
            used with limited or no labeled data.

            Not every neural network is a simple multilayer perceptron.
            Different types of networks have been developed to learn different 
            kinds of patterns. In this section, we discuss new architectures, 
            many of which come from computer vision or natural langauge processing.
